Restaurant Management:

Application uses console input and saves/edits .txt file basing on it.
Possible actions are:
-> add - action used to add an order, it requires you to input respectively:
order name [String]; table number [Integer]; order time [LocalTime]; order cost [BigDecimal]
-> delete - action allows to delete all or specific orders from txt file
-> read - action used to show orders list / specific order from txt file in console
-> sort - sorts orders list basing on order time
-> exit - turns off application by ending the loop
